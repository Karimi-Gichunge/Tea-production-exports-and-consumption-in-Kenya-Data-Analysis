## Description
This is a brief analysis that was done on Kenya's agricultural sector with a major focus on the tea industry. 


Agriculture is the engine of economic growth in Kenya. About 75% of Kenyans earn all or part of their income from this sector. Agriculture accounts for 33% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). The Tea industry impacts greatly on the Kenyan economy as it is the main cash crop grown in the country exporting over 450,000 TONS of high quality tea every year. This makes Kenya one of the world's largest exporters of Tea with markerts from Egypt, Europe, Pakistan and all over the world. 


The main activities around the Tea Industry in Kenya are:
* Production - Mainly produced as black tea but new exotic flavours are coming up. 
* Consumption - Tea is the most popular hot drink in Kenya.
* Export - Kenya is responsible for 25% of Tea exports worldwide. 


The main aim of this project was to manipulate and analyse data to make a study on the pattern and trends in the production, consumption and export of Tea in Kenya. The results of this project can then be used in predicting future trends and also to improve the tea trade. 


## Data Anaysis
Analysis was done on the consumption, exports and production of tea over the years 2012 - 2015. 

We verified that total consumption and total exports do not necessarily equal to total production. One of the reasons is that tea produced in January could be consumed or exported months later. In addition, some of the tea growing areas have poor infrastructure like inaccessible roads which could make transporting and preserving viability challenging.


The recommendations are that this analysis should be combined with similar trend analysis such as weather patterns, farming trends and economic conditions related to the agricultural industries in the same horizon for further analysis.


## Complete Setup / Installation Requirements
To open and view the python analysis on the notebook, you will need Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory. Do have a look at it.ðŸ˜Š

## Technologies used
We used Python 3 to perform data cleaning, analysis and visualization

We made use of Python libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib
